## Project

Salvo is a multiplayer shared-ocean Battleship game. All players' ships occupy the same 10x10 grid — every shot affects everyone.

### Commands
```
npm run dev          # Start server (3000) + client (5173)
npm test -w server   # Run tests (vitest, 91 tests)
npx tsc --noEmit -p server/tsconfig.json  # Type-check server
npx tsc --noEmit -p client/tsconfig.json  # Type-check client
```

### Architecture
- **shared/src/types.ts** — All types, socket events, computed getters (isShipSunk, isPlayerAlive, playerShotCount)
- **server/src/game.ts** — Pure game logic, no I/O. toClientView() is the security boundary — never leaks ship positions
- **server/src/connections.ts** — playerId↔socketId mapping, 60s reconnect window, event buffering
- **server/src/ai.ts** — AI opponents: 4 tiers (Easy/Medium/Hard/Impossible), ship placement + target selection
- **server/src/lobby.ts** — Game lifecycle, join codes (collision-safe), cleanup timer
- **server/src/index.ts** — Express + socket.io event routing, turn timer management, bot auto-play, Quick Play queue (socket.io rooms)
- **client/src/main.ts** — Single-file vanilla TS client: state management, socket handlers, DOM rendering
- **client/src/style.css** — Full DESIGN.md implementation

### Key Decisions
- Ship.sunk, Player.alive, Player.shotCount are computed getters, not stored state
- Salvos resolve atomically — all shots land before checking alive status
- toClientView() is the single chokepoint for all outbound game state (security tests enforce this)
- Reconnection buffers events during 60s disconnect window
- Unified single grid — no separate fleet/target grids (shared ocean = one grid)
- Per-player stats (shots, hits, accuracy, FF) accumulated during fireSalvo, computed at game-over
- Version is single-source from package.json, injected by Vite at build time via `__APP_VERSION__`
- Game.mode ('private' | 'quickplay-1v1' | 'quickplay-ffa') distinguishes game types for counters and future ranked play
- Quick Play rematch destroys the game and requeues players (clean game boundaries); private rematch resets in-place
- Versioning: 0.X.0 = new features, 0.0.X = bugfixes, X.0.0 = major (fundamentally different game)

## gstack

For all web browsing, use the `/browse` skill from gstack. Never use `mcp__claude-in-chrome__*` tools.

Available gstack skills:
- `/office-hours`
- `/plan-ceo-review`
- `/plan-eng-review`
- `/plan-design-review`
- `/design-consultation`
- `/review`
- `/ship`
- `/browse`
- `/qa`

- `/guard`
- `/unfreeze`
- `/gstack-upgrade`

If gstack skills aren't working, run `cd .claude/skills/gstack && ./setup` to build the binary and register skills.

## Design System
Always read DESIGN.md before making any visual or UI decisions.
All font choices, colors, spacing, and aesthetic direction are defined there.
Do not deviate without explicit user approval.
In QA mode, flag any code that doesn't match DESIGN.md.
